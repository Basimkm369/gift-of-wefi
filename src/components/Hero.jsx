          At WEFI, we help children learn, grow, and discover their potential
          in a happy and supportive way. We believe learning should feel
          exciting - not stressful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our programs are thoughtfully designed so kids enjoy learning, and
          parents feel confident and at ease. We focus on strong basics, good
          values, and a love for learning that goes beyond exams.
        </p>
        <p>
          You haven't just enrolled for an exam. You're joining a small,
          friendly learning family that truly cares about your journey 💙
